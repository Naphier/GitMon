Thanks for thinking about contributing!
I'm using VS for this project. There you'll find a few TODOs in the Task List window if you'd like to help.

If you're thinking about changing the layout then please consult me first. I'm open to ideas, but the layout was a pain.

You'll need Electron via npm to run the project.
