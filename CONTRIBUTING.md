Thanks for thinking about contributing!
I'm using VS for this project. There you'll find a few TODOs in the Task List window if you'd like to help.

If you're thinking about changing the layout then please consult me first. I'm open to ideas, but the layout was a pain.

You'll need Electron via npm to run the project.

Please do all work in the development branch.

When running from Visual Studio's Node.js Interactive console use `.npm start -- --vs` to ensure that the argument to set debug mode is passed to main. This will also work with the `--inspect-brk` option if you're attaching a debugger.
